USE CASES OF SOME OF MY IDEAS

do you use gas stoves for when you are preparing meals?
do you have any generators that make use of fuel ?

when was the last time you replaced your gas cylinders?
when was the last time you the filled your generators?

how often do you replace gas cylinders and fill fuel in generators?

would you like an application that reminds you to replace gas cylinders and allows you to order from your nearest fuel station? (as well as order fuel for generators)

do you have any suggestions for features that would make this application more attractive for you ?
